# Be aware that YAML interprets the following case-insensitive strings as booleans:
# `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`, `y`, `n`
#
# Therefore, these strings must be quoted to be interpreted as strings. For example:
#     en:
#       "yes": yup
#       enabled: "ON"

        user_create_failure: Could not create user.
        incorrect_password: Incorrect password.
  username_not_found: There is no user with username '%{username}'.
